# Flow

Flow is a inventory UI animation mod that allows you to configure an ease in-out animation when opening and closing any inventory screens.

# Compatability

Flow is **likely already compatible with a wide range of mods**, but has built in fixes to work with many mods, such as EMI.

# Configuration

Flow has a wide range of configuration options, from background tint and blur, to the type of easing used to animate the movement in or out.

# Roadmap

- Animation directions, more complex transitions. Slide in from left/right etc.
- More configurable blur/tint animations.
